<div class="textblock"><p>In order to effectively manage tables, an operator needs to understand how cFE Applications manage tables from their end. There are a number of methods that cFE Applications typically use to manage their tables. Each method is appropriate based upon the nature of the contents of the table.</p>
<p>cFE Applications are required to periodically check to see if their table is to be validated, updated (or in the case of dump-only tables, dumped). Most Applications perform this periodic management at the same time as housekeeping requests are processed. This table management is performed by the cFE Application that "owns" a table (ie - the cFE Application that registered the table with cFE Table Services). It is possible for cFE Applications to "share" a table with other cFE Applications. An Application that shares a table does not typically perform any of the management duties associated with that table.</p>
<p>A table can have one of two different types and a number of different options. These are discussed further in later sections. An operator should understand the chosen type and selected options for a particular table before attempting to modify a table's contents.</p>
<p>To understand the methods of maintaining a table, it is important that the terminology be clear. A table has two images: "Active" and "Inactive". The Active table is the one that a cFE Application is currently accessing when it executes. The Inactive table is a copy of the Active table that an operator (or on-board process such as a stored command processor) can manipulate and change to have a newly desired set of data.</p>
<p>To create an Inactive table image on board, the operator would be required to perform a "Load" to the table. Loads are table images stored in on-board files. The Load can contain either a complete table image or just a part of a table image. If the Load contains just a portion, the Inactive image is first initialized with the contents of the Active image and then the portion identified in the Load file is written on top of the Active image. After the initial Load, an operator can continue to manipulate the Inactive table image with additional partial table load images. This allows the operator to reconfigure the contents of multiple portions of the table before deciding to "Validate" and/or "Activate" it.</p>
<p>Some cFE Applications provide special functions that will examine a table image to determine if the contents are logically sound. This function is referred to as the "Validation Function." When a cFE Application assigns a Validation Function to a table during the table registration process, it is then requiring that a Validation be performed before the table can be Activated. When an operator requests a Validation of a table image, they are sending a request to the owning Application to execute the associated Validation Function on that image. The results of this function are then reported in telemetry. If the Validation is successful, the operator is free to perform a table Activation. If the Validation fails, the operator would be required to make additional changes to the Inactive table image and attempt another Validation before commanding an Activation.</p>
<p>To change an Inactive table image into the Active table image, an operator must Activate a table. When an operator sends the table Activation command, they are notifying the table's owning Application that a new table image is available. It is then up to the Application to determine when is the best time to perform the "Update" of the table. When an Application performs an Update, the contents of the Inactive table image become the Active table image.</p>
