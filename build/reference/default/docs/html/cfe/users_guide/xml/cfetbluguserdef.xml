    <title>User Defined Address Tables</title>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>In order to provide a mechanism for Flight Software Maintenance teams to quickly create a table image for dumping contents of memory that isn&apos;t normally loaded by the ground, there is an option to create User-Defined Address tables. These tables, when they are first registered, provide a memory address where the Active image of the table is to be maintained. Normally, the address is specified by Table Services from its memory pool.</para><para>By specifying the address, the Flight Software Maintenance team can create a Dump-Only table that contains the contents of a data structure that is not normally accessible via telemetry or table dumps. Then, on command, the Flight Software Maintenance team can periodically dump the data structure&apos;s contents to an on-board file(s) that can then be transferred to the ground for later analysis.</para><para>Next: <ref refid="cfetblugdumponly" kindref="compound">Dump Only Tables</ref> <linebreak/>
