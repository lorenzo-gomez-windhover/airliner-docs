<para>The software bus has a parameter in the <ref refid="cfe__sb_8h_1a5939c3681044a3d953d0fe72dd577889" kindref="member">CFE_SB_SubscribeEx</ref> API named Quality, which means Quality of Service (QOS) for off-board routing and is of the type <ref refid="struct_c_f_e___s_b___qos__t" kindref="compound">CFE_SB_Qos_t</ref>. This structure has two members named priority and reliability. The Quality parameter is currently unused by the software bus. It is a placeholder to be used with the future software bus capability of inter-processor communication. Although currently the software bus does not read the Quality values, it would be best to set this parameter to the value defined as <ref refid="cfe__sb_8h_1aa20e8d7fe06a65514dd39e65a7be5ca5" kindref="member">CFE_SB_Default_Qos</ref>. This value is set internally by the software bus with values of zero for priority and reliability. The values of zero will correspond to low priority and low reliability. Setting the QOS value to the <ref refid="cfe__sb_8h_1aa20e8d7fe06a65514dd39e65a7be5ca5" kindref="member">CFE_SB_Default_Qos</ref> will ensure seamless integration when the software bus is expanded to support inter-processor communication.</para><para>Next: <ref refid="cfesbugknwnprob" kindref="compound">Known Problem</ref> <linebreak/>
