    <title>Time Components</title>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>Time knowledge is stored in several pieces, so that the time information can more easily be manipulated and utilized. These components include:</para><para>The <bold>Ground Epoch</bold> is an arbitrary date and time that establishes the zero point for spacecraft time calculations. The selection of the epoch is mission specific, although in the past, it was common to select the same epoch as defined for the Operating System used by the computers hosting the ground system software. Recent mission epoch selections have also included using zero seconds after midnight, Jan 1, 2001.</para><para><bold>Spacecraft Time</bold> is the number of seconds (and fraction of a second) since the ground epoch. Spacecraft time is the sum of <bold>Mission Elapsed Time</bold> (MET) and the <bold>Spacecraft Time Correlation Factor</bold> (STCF). By definition, MET is a measure of time since launch or separation. However, for most missions the MET actually represents the amount of time since powering on the hardware containing the MET timer. The STCF correlates the MET to the ground epoch.</para><para>The <bold>Tone</bold> is the signal that MET seconds have incremented. In most hardware configurations, the tone is synonymous with the <bold>1 PPS</bold> signal. The tone signal may be generated by a local hardware timer, or by an external event (GPS receiver, spacewire time tick, 1553 bus signal, etc). TIME may also be configured to simulate the tone for lab environments that do not have the necessary hardware to provide a tone signal. Note that MET sub-seconds will be zero at the instant of the tone.</para><para><bold>Time at the Tone</bold> is the spacecraft time at the most recent &quot;valid&quot; tone.</para><para><bold>Time since the Tone</bold> is the amount of time since the tone (usually less than one second). This value is often measured using the local processor clock. Upon detecting the tone signal, TIME stores the contents of the local processor clock to facilitate this measurement.</para><para>Thus, <bold>Current Spacecraft Time</bold> is the sum of &quot;time at the tone&quot; and &quot;time since the tone&quot;.</para><para><bold>Leap Seconds</bold> occur to keep clocks correlated to astronomical observations. The modern definition of a second (9,192,631,770 oscillations of a cesium-133 atom) is constant while the earth&apos;s rotation has been slow by a small fraction of a second per day. The <bold>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service</bold> (IERS) maintains the count of leap seconds as a signed whole number that is subject to update twice a year. Although it is possible to have a negative leap second count if the earth rotates too fast, it is highly unlikely. The initial count of leap seconds (10) was established in January of 1972, the first leap second was added to the initial count in June of 1972, and the current count of leap seconds is 33.</para><para>Next: <ref refid="cfetimeugstruct" kindref="compound">Time Structure</ref> <linebreak/>
