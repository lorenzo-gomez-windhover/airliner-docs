<tr>
<td width="5%">&#160; </td><td width="95%">The memory pool handle is used to analyze the SB memory pool statistics. The cFE ES command (<a class="el" href="cfe__es__msg_8h.html#a2b1c39432940423ef68c4c183abce3d8">CFE_ES_TLM_POOL_STATS_CC</a>) to dump the memory pool statistics takes the pool handle as a parameter. These statistics tell how the SB memory pool is configured and gives details on margin. An improperly configured SB memory pool may inhibit communication. This may occur if there is not enough margin to create a block of the size needed for a transfer. Refer to the ES memory pool users guide for more details. <a class="el" href="cfeesugmempoolsrv.html">Memory Pool Service</a> <br />

<tr>
<td width="5%">&#160; </td><td width="95%">To route the message properly, the software bus uses only the Message ID and packet length fields from the header of the message. If the packet length field is incorrect, then the buffer allocation for the message will also be incorrect. This may appear to the receiver as a truncated message or a message with unknown data added to the end of the message. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" width="100%"><b>(Q) How many copies of the message are performed in a typical message delivery? </b></td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="5%">&#160; </td><td width="95%">There is a single copy of the message performed during a typical delivery. During the <a class="el" href="cfe__sb__api_8c.html#a91b4b63f7d168bd78dc92d894ad7f77d" title="Send a software bus message.

This is equivalent to the copy mode send and pointer mode receive in the heritage software bus used on WMAP, ST5, SDO etc. </td></tr>

Or how long is the message, and the pointer to the message in the <a class="el" href="cfe__sb__api_8c.html#a54840fe06aeb08b1e2c8df420474780d" title="Receive a message from a software bus pipe.

<td width="5%">&#160; </td><td width="95%">Typically a caller declares a ptr of type <a class="el" href="union_c_f_e___s_b___msg__t.html" title="Generic Software Bus Message Type Definition. ">CFE_SB_Msg_t</a> (i.e. <a class="el" href="union_c_f_e___s_b___msg__t.html" title="Generic Software Bus Message Type Definition.

After a successful call to <a class="el" href="cfe__sb__api_8c.html#a54840fe06aeb08b1e2c8df420474780d" title="Receive a message from a software bus pipe.

In systems with an MMU, writes to this pointer may cause a memory protection fault. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" width="100%"><b>(Q) Why am I not seeing expected Message Limit error events or Pipe Overflow events? </b></td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="5%">&#160; </td><td width="95%">It is possible the events are being filtered by cFE Event Services. The filtering for this event may be specified in the platform configuration file or it may have been commanded after the system initializes.<br />
 There is a corresponding counter for each of these conditions. First verify that the condition is happening by viewing the counter in SB HK telemetry. If the condition is happening, you can view the SB filter information through the EVS App Data Main page by clicking the 'go to' button for SB. The event Id for these events can be learned through a previous event or from the <a class="el" href="cfe__sb__events_8h.html">cfe_sb_events.h</a> file. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" width="100%"><b>(Q) Why does the SB provide event filtering through the platform configuration file? </b></td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="5%">&#160; </td><td width="95%">To give the user the ability to filter events before an EVS command can be sent. During system initialization, there are many conditions occurring that can cause a flood of SB events such as No Subscribers, Pipe Overflow and MsgId to Pipe errors. This gives the user a way to limit these events. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" width="100%"><b>(Q) Why does SB have so many debug event messages? </b></td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="5%">&#160; </td><td width="95%">The SB debug messages are positive acknowledgments that an action (like receiving a cmd, creating a pipe or subscribing to a message) has occurred. They are intended to help isolate system problems. For instance, if an expected response to a command is not happening, it may be possible to repeat the scenario with the debug event turned on to verify that the command was successfully received. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" width="100%"><b>(Q) How is the QOS parameter in the <a class="el" href="cfe__sb__api_8c.html#a5939c3681044a3d953d0fe72dd577889" title="Subscribe to a message on the software bus. ">CFE_SB_SubscribeEx</a> used by the software bus? </b></td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="5%">&#160; </td><td width="95%">The QOS parameter is currently unused by the software bus. It is a placeholder to be used with the future software bus capability of inter-processor communication. Setting the QOS value to the SB defined <a class="el" href="cfe__sb__task_8c.html#aa20e8d7fe06a65514dd39e65a7be5ca5" title="Defines a default priority and reliabilty for off-board routing. ">CFE_SB_Default_Qos</a> (QOS.Priority=0,QOS.Reliability=0) will ensure seamless integration when the software bus is expanded to support inter-processor communication. </td></tr>
