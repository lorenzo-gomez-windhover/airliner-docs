    <title>Setting MET</title>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>The TIME Server provides the capability to set the MET. Note that the MET (as implemented for cFE Time Service) is a logical representation and not a physical timer. Thus, setting the MET is not dependent on whether the hardware supports a MET register that can be written to. Note also that Time Service &quot;assumes&quot; that during normal operation, the MET is synchronized to the tone signal. Therefore, unless operating in FLYWHEEL mode, the sub-seconds portion of the MET will be set to zero at the next tone signal interrupt. The new MET takes effect immediately upon execution of this command.</para><para><simplesect kind="see"><para><ref refid="cfe__time__msg_8h_1aabc0a122fca4548b3da6bd0337d0ad29" kindref="member">CFE_TIME_SET_MET_CC</ref></para></simplesect>
