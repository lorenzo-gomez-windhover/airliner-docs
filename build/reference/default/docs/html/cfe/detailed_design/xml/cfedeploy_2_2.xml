    <title>Configure the Build Directory for a Mission</title>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>The build directory is where the cFE is configured and compiled for a mission. The build directory is designed to hold the cFE configuration for all of the processors on a mission. Each processor can have its own unique architecture and cFE configuration. <linebreak/>

 The cFE source distribution comes with a reference build directory. The reference build directory contains four sub-directories: cpu1, cpu2, cpu3, and inc. These three cpu directories are setup to run vxWorks6.4 on an MCP750 PPC evaluation board. <linebreak/>
</para><para>The &quot;cpu&quot; directories can be renamed, deleted, or duplicated to match the number of processors on a mission. For example, if a mission has a RAD750 processor, a Coldfire processor, and a PC/Linux platform for running the cFE in a desktop environment, the CPU directories can be renamed to &quot;rad750&quot;, &quot;coldfire&quot;, and &quot;desktop&quot;. The &apos;inc&apos; directory contains header files that are common to all platforms in the mission. The &apos;inc&apos; directory is most useful for projects with two or more CPUs running the cFE.</para><para>Next: <ref refid="cfedeploy_2_3" kindref="compound">Configure the cFE Core for Each CPU Directory</ref> <linebreak/>
