<para>The Core Flight Executive (cFE) is required to be built with the Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL) and Platform Support Package (PSP) componenets of the Core Flight System (cFS). It is always recommended to build with the latest versions of each of the components as backward compatability may not be supported. <linebreak/>

The size of the &quot;char&quot; data type and whether or not the type is signed or unsigned can change across platforms. The cFE assumes use of the &quot;char&quot; data type as an <bold> 8-bit type. </bold> </para>    </detaileddescription>
