    <title>Transfer the cFE Applications and Startup File to the Target Non-Volatile Disk</title>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>Define the applications to be started automatically by the CFE_ES startup code. The startup file (default name:<bold>cfe_es_startup.scr</bold>) contains a list of applications that will be started by the CFE_ES startup code immediately after the cFE initializes. Applications may also be started at a later time via the <bold>CFE_ES_StartApp</bold> command. By default, only the applications needed for communication with the ground system are listed in the startup script. There is also a test library loaded in the default script to demonstrate how a set of library functions can be loaded.</para><para><bold>NOTE:</bold>In older versions of the cFE, the startup file had to be set to an exact path: &quot;/cf/apps/cfe_es_startup.scr&quot;. Starting with cFE version 4.1, the path and name of the startup file is passed into the cFE entry point (<ref refid="stubs_8c_1a80b9e43e0efa587a70bd4707fee4f5f8" kindref="member">CFE_ES_Main</ref>) from the Board Support Package. Because of this, there are no longer constraints on the name or path of the Non-Volatile file system. The cFE will attempt to open the startup file that was passed in.</para><para>Before transferring the cFE Apps and startup script, check that the startup script has the correct extension for the files by editing the file with a text editor.</para><para><center> <heading level="4">cFE Application extensions for different target operating systems: </heading>

</para><para>Once the startup script is finalized, copy the startup script and the cFE applications to the Non-Volatile disk on the target. The default path to use is &quot;/cf/apps&quot; for both the startup script and cFE Applications, but it is not limited to that path or name. In the case of a Linux desktop implementation, the files would be copied to &quot;/tmp/eedev0/apps&quot;. On the RAD750, the files would be copied to the &quot;apps&quot; directory on the &quot;EEP:0&quot; device, or &quot;/EEP:0/apps&quot;.</para><para>Next: <ref refid="cfedeploy_2_6_4" kindref="compound">Description of Fields in the Startup script</ref> <linebreak/>
