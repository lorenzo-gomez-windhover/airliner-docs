    <title>Table Registry</title>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>When Applications register tables, Table Services retains pertinent information on the table in the Table Registry. The following information (along with other information that is less important for an operator) is kept for each table:</para><para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The Application ID of the Application that Registered the table </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The full name of the table </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The size, in bytes, of the table </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Pointers to the start addresses of the Table&apos;s image buffers, Active and Inactive (if appropriate) </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A pointer to the start address of a Validation Function </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A flag indicating whether a table image has been loaded into an Inactive buffer </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A flag indicating whether the table is Critical and its associated CDS Handle if it is </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A flag indicating whether the table has ever been loaded (initialized) </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A flag indicating whether the table is Dump Only </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A flag indicating whether the table has an Update Pending </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A flag indicating whether the table is double buffered or not </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The System Time when the Table was last Updated </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The filename of the last file loaded into the table </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The File Creation Time for the last file used to load the contents of the table </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para><para>This information can be obtained by either sending the Dump Registry command which will put all of the information from the Table Registry into an onboard file for later downlink or the operator can send a command to Telemeter the Registry Entry for a single table. This will cause the pertinent registry entry for a single table to be sent via a telemetry packet.</para><para>The API function <ref refid="cfe__tbl_8h_1a02649cb295b154981365de11e0bb6683" kindref="member">CFE_TBL_Register()</ref> returns either CFE_SUCCESS or CFE_TBL_INFO_RECOVERED_TBL to indicate that the table was successfully registered. The difference is whether the table data was recovered from CDS as part of the registration. There are several error return values that describe why the function failed to register the table but nothing related to why the restoration from CDS might have failed. There is, however, a message written to the System Error Log by Table Services that can be dumped by the ground to get this information. Note that failure to restore a table from CDS is not an expected error and requires some sort of data corruption to occur.</para><para>Next: <ref refid="cfetblugtelemetry" kindref="compound">Table Services Telemetry</ref> <linebreak/>
