    <title>Performance Data Collection Trigger Masks</title>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>The trigger mask is used to tell the Performance Data Collection tool, precisely when to start collecting the data. There is a bit in the trigger mask for every marker used in the code. After a start command is received, the trigger mask is read and dictates when the performance tool begins storing data in the buffer.</para><para>If the trigger mask is set to all zeros, then the collection will begin immediately after the start command and continue until a stop command is received. In this case the buffer behaves in a &apos;circular&apos; manner.</para><para>Next: <ref refid="cfeesugperfmodes" kindref="compound">Performance Data Collection Modes</ref> <linebreak/>
