    <title>Effects of Processor Reset on Tables</title>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>When a processor resets, the Table Registry is re-initialized. All Applications must, therefore, re-register and re-initialize their tables. The one exception, however, is if the Application has previously tagged a table as &quot;Critical&quot; during Table Registration, then Table Services will attempt to locate a table image for that table stored in the Critical Data Store. Table Services also attempts to locate the Critical Table Registry which is also maintained in the Critical Data Store.</para><para>If Table Services is able to find a valid table image for a Critical table in the Critical Data Store, the contents of the table are automatically loaded into the table and the Application is notified that the table does not require additional initialization.</para><para>Next: <ref refid="cfetblugfaq" kindref="compound">Frequently Asked Questions about Table Services</ref> <linebreak/>
