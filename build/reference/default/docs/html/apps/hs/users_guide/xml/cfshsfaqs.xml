<para><bold> (Q) Why is there no option to start an RTS in response to Application Monitor failure or Event Monitor detection? </bold> <linebreak/>
 <linebreak/>
 <emphasis> RTSes may still be started using Message Actions, provided your system is using the Stored Command (SC) Application. Message Actions were added in favor of retaining RTS capabilities as they provide a more generic solution (such as systems without SC or with an alternative type of SC). </emphasis></para><para><bold> (Q) What if no events need to be monitored? </bold> <linebreak/>
 <linebreak/>
 <emphasis> The Event Monitor Table must exist (and so must be of non-zero length), but Event Monitoring can be disabled by default. Event Monitoring may always be useful at some point in the future life of a mission, so be sure that enough spare entries are available (even if all entries are spares). </emphasis></para><para><bold> (Q) What if no Message Actions are needed? </bold> <linebreak/>
