<div class="textblock"><p>To integrate the MM application into the cFE, follow the CFS Deployment Guide.</p>
<p>Follow the general guidelines below for platform deployment of the Memory Manager Application.</p>
<p>Since the MM application uses files for dumps and loads, directories and file volumes need to be setup and initialized correctly through the cFE for these operations to work properly. MM will use the full path specified in a command message (up to the max specified by #OS_MAX_PATH_LEN) without modification for file operations.</p>
<p>MM relies on the OSAL for validation of address arguments. It uses the function #CFE_PSP_MemValidateRange to check address and data size parameters for dump and load operations. The memory map used by #CFE_PSP_MemValidateRange needs to be setup correctly for the platform, otherwise these parameter checks may fail unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Code to support the MM_MEM32, MM_MEM16, and MM_MEM8 memory types (see <a class="el" href="cfsmmugmemtypes.html">Memory Types</a>) is conditionally compiled based upon configuration parameter settings (see <a class="el" href="cfsmmcfg.html">CFS Memory Manager Configuration Parameters</a>). If support for these types is not needed, excluding them can reduce the MM code footprint.</p>
<p>The maximum amount of data that can be dumped to (or loaded from) a file can also be changed by adjusting configuration parameter settings (see <a class="el" href="cfsmmcfg.html">CFS Memory Manager Configuration Parameters</a>). Since MM processes commands and housekeeping requests serially from a single command pipe, setting these limits to large values may cause late responses to housekeeping requests. If a mission requires large dumps or loads, it may be better to split the operation so it uses several smaller files instead of one very large one.</p>
<p>Only one message ID must be included in the CFE Scheduler Table: <a class="el" href="mm__msgids_8h.html#a439cb9c4af6a8485142361cc3ee96ed8" title="Msg ID to request mm HK. ">MM_SEND_HK_MID</a> is sent out at the housekeeping request interval.</p>
<p>The Memory Manager app generates telemetry when it receives the housekeeping request. Its telemetry message ID is <a class="el" href="mm__msgids_8h.html#a72e678d5ee7488007ba444e43358f82e" title="MM Housekeeping Telemetry. ">MM_HK_TLM_MID</a>.</p>
<p>The cFE ES app uses five performance IDs to keep track of the performance of the MM app: <a class="el" href="mm__perfids_8h.html#aed6254bca3273f49a141bdaa26f081fd">MM_APPMAIN_PERF_ID</a> is used to track overall app performance.<br />
 <a class="el" href="mm__perfids_8h.html#ac4edd624bf22f1fa32e6b9c025f0bafc">MM_SEGBREAK_PERF_ID</a> is used to track performance during segment breaks, which prevent CPU hogging during load-from-file, dump-to-file, or fill operations.<br />
 <a class="el" href="mm__perfids_8h.html#aaeab86edc7a9c695a208ffff80e929b6">MM_EEPROM_POKE_PERF_ID</a> is used to track performance during poke operations.<br />
 <a class="el" href="mm__perfids_8h.html#a477c2b8ed359aac8620f03c75865a200">MM_EEPROM_FILELOAD_PERF_ID</a> is used to track performance during file load operations.<br />

</p>
<p>The mission configuration file <a class="el" href="mm__mission__cfg_8h.html">mm_mission_cfg.h</a> contains parameters that are used across all platforms on a mission. The defined parameters and their default values are:</p>

<p>The platform configuration file <a class="el" href="mm__platform__cfg_8h.html">mm_platform_cfg.h</a> contains parameters that can be adjusted to specific platforms. The defined parameters (and their default values) are:</p>
<p><a class="el" href="mm__platform__cfg_8h.html#ae105c9da23ad19833784455616557acd">MM_MAX_LOAD_FILE_DATA_RAM</a> defines the maximum number of bytes that can be loaded into RAM from a single load file.
