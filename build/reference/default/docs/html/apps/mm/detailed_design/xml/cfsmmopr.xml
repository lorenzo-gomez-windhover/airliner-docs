</para><para>Because MM is bascially an interface to the PSP and OSAL memory utilities, the app only performs basic initialization steps (e.g., registering the app, subscribing to housekeeping and ground commands, initializing counters and housekeeping data). MM does not maintain any tables or critical data storage (CDS) areas, so no actions are taken during initialization.</para><para>Once initialization is complete, MM will pend indefinitely for a command (either ground or housekeeping) and wake up to process the received command.</para><para>Next: <ref refid="cfsmmreq" kindref="compound">CFS Memory Manager Requirements</ref> <linebreak/>
