</para><para>Potential causes for <ref refid="class_m_p_c" kindref="compound">MPC</ref> to terminate prematurely are an error return from the software bus in the application main loop or error return from one of the cFE table services functions when <ref refid="class_m_p_c" kindref="compound">MPC</ref> tries to do table management (check for updates, dump requests etc.) during each housekeeping cycle.</para><para><heading level="1">Critical Data Store Operation </heading>
</para><para>When using the Critical Data Store (CDS), the results tables and housekeeping data will only be restored if the application was shut down through cFE Executive Services and exited clean.
