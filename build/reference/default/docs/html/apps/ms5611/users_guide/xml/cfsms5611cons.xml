</para><para>Potential causes for MS5611 to terminate prematurely are an error return from the software bus in the application main loop or error return from one of the cFE table services functions when MS5611 tries to do table management (check for updates, dump requests etc.) during each housekeeping cycle.</para><para><heading level="1">Critical Data Store Operation </heading>
</para><para>When using the Critical Data Store (CDS), the results tables and housekeeping data will only be restored if the application was shut down through cFE Executive Services and exited clean. If this is not the case, default values will be used (see <ref refid="cfsms5611faqs" kindref="compound">MS5611 Application Frequently Asked Questions</ref>).</para><para>Next: <ref refid="cfsms5611faqs" kindref="compound">MS5611 Application Frequently Asked Questions</ref> <linebreak/>
