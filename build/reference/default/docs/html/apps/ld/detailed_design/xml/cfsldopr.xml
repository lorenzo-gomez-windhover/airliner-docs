    <detaileddescription>
<para>The following operations are carried out by the <ref refid="class_l_d" kindref="compound">LD</ref> Application: <heading level="2">1.Detect if vehicle is in free fall state </heading>
</para><para>1) If parameter LD_FFALL_THR is set to zero or invalid, disable free-fall detection.<linebreak/>
 2) Get x,y,z accelerations acting on the vehicle and compute the net acceleration.<linebreak/>
 3) If acceleration is less than LD_FFALL_THR, flag state to true.<linebreak/>
 <heading level="2">2.Detect if vehicle is has ground contact state </heading>
</para><para>1) If the vehicle is not armed then it is in ground contact state.<linebreak/>
 2) Never report landed in manual mode if: <orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>If the user has more than idle throttle. </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Check throttle and report no ground contact based on the pilots intent to take off. </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
3) Increase acceptance thresholds for landed state after arming the vehicle so that the increasing motor speed and other effects do not trigger false negatives.<linebreak/>
 4) Mark vehicle state as ground contact if. <orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Not moving vertically. </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Pilot reduces thrust, or in auto mode we are below minimum thrust. </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>We cannot move any further down. </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<heading level="2">3.Detect if vehicle is landed state </heading>
</para><para>1) If the vehicle is not armed then it is in landed state.<linebreak/>
 2) If the vehicle is manually controlled and is idling, vehicle stays in landed state until the pilot increases throttle for takeoff. <orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>If throttle is more than a given threshold, set ground contact state history to false. </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
3) If the vehicle is not in altitude lock mode, check if the vehicle has minimum thrust and the drone stays that way of at least LD_MIN_THR_NO_ALT_TIMEOUT seconds then mark state as landed.<linebreak/>
 4) Increase acceptance thresholds for landed state after arming the vehicle so that the increasing motor speed and other effects do not trigger false negatives.<linebreak/>
 5) Mark vehicle state as landed if. <orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Not moving horizontally. </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Have no thrust. (look if all rotation angles are not moving) </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Ground contact persists. </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<heading level="2">4.Determining current state of the vehicle </heading>
</para><para>1) The state of the vehicle is determined by the land detector. A vehicle is said to be in landed state if it has seen a ground contact state previously.<linebreak/>
